# CMI-LANDGAH-StrategicChange-Analysis

This is where I've put all my work from the Leading Strategic Change through Creativity and Innovation (CMI) module (7051CRB). I dove deep into Legal & General Affordable Homes (LANDGAH), figured out what's shaking up their business, and came up with a plan to help them grow and tackle their challenges.

## What's This Project About?

So, I was looking at what's making LANDGAH change and how they can do things better. Here's the lowdown:

* **Figuring Out What's Happening:** I used the Burke-Litwin model to see how everything inside and outside LANDGAH is connected and causing changes.
* **Checking Their Strategy:** I used Michael Porter's Value Chain to see what LANDGAH's doing right and where they could improve. I suggested things like using modular construction, digital twins, making their processes smoother, handling leasing themselves, doing smarter marketing with data, and using AI in their Brolly CRM for better customer service.
* **Making Change Happen:** I put together a plan using Kotter’s 8-Step Transformation Model to actually get these changes done. It's all about getting everyone on board, showing them the vision, and making sure the changes stick.
* **Getting Creative:** I used both brainstorming and focused thinking to come up with ideas, like the AI in the CRM and the digital twins. I also did some reverse engineering and mind mapping to name the project and come up with a tagline.
* **Branding It:** I called the project "Project Beacon" (because, you know, guiding people to homes) and the tagline is "Guiding the way to better homes." I also designed a logo (using some inspiration from Legal & General’s branding) and made an info leaflet and presentation.
* **Thinking About Me:** I used Gibbs’ Reflective Model to see what I learned and how I can improve. I took an MBTI test (turns out, I'm an ENTJ - Commander) and figured out my learning style (Reflector, Pragmatist, Theorist). I also looked at my leadership skills and made some SMART goals to get better at working with others and managing change.

## What's in Here?

## Why I'm Sharing This

This was for a CMI assignment, and I wanted to show how I can take what I've learned about strategic change, creativity, and innovation and apply it to a real-world situation. Basically, it's me showing off my problem-solving and analytical skills.
